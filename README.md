# üëã Hi there!
I'm John. I studied computer science at the University of South Florida and currently work as a Software Engineer at [Citi](https://www.citi.com/). Here you'll find some side projects of mine from the past (messy-code alert but hey we all start somewhere üòä) and some that I am currently working on!

I am a passionate problem solver, interested in the exploration of computational solutions to practical, humanitarian, and ethical issues. I hope to add value to the world and contribute to solutions that help our neighbors. 

Onward friends, there is grace for the journey! ‚òÄÔ∏è

## Projects
- [Personal Finance Budgeting App](https://github.com/money-solutions/budget-app):
Collaboratively developed a budgeting web-application with a peer student developer for users to create budgets and manage financial transactions. Proposed and implemented the relational database design schema and REST API endpoints. Implemented automated tests with Mocha & Chai and managed project lifecycle using Jira within an Agile framework.
- [Efficient Sudoku](https://github.com/johnelliott626/sudoku):
I created an artificial intelligence agent using constraint satisfaction problem techniques that solves sudoku puzzles. The program implements 4 different solution variations and compares the performance of the state space complexity of each solution and highlights the optimal algorithmic solution.
- [Mindful Coach](https://github.com/SWE-JacksonTeam/MindfulCoach):
Worked with a team of student developers to create an appointment scheduling CRM platform for a fictional life coaching company. Proposed system architectural design to team, implemented it, and learned Django and React.
- [Stock Analysis App](https://github.com/johnelliott626/stock-analysis):
I created a C# Desktop application that analyzes stock data (from a CSV file) to recognize various candlestick patterns. 
- [Stock Trader Web App](https://github.com/johnelliott626/stock-trader): 
I developed a web-based application using Python, Flask, and SQLite that allows users to perform fictional stock market transactions based upon real-time market data. Learned how to develop, debug, test, and deploy a full-stack web
application.
